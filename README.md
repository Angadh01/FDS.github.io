My name is Angadh Bazaad and I am 21 year old male living in Sydney, Australia. My nationality is(some info on nationality and culture), I was born in Sydney. I am Bi lingual able to speak Hindi, Urdu and English. I have completed year 12 - HSC and have been working part time in.… (some sort of work experience) I have a key interest in team sports, video games, working out and trying new foods. I love animals and have a few pets of my own which include 2 dogs and a parrot. Other hobbies of mine include watching tv series and playing mobile games specifically clash of clans which is a team oriented game. Since I was a child I have been enjoying team sports and always thrived in such environments. 

##Interest in IT

Growing up I have always been intrigued by console games, computers, tv’s and how they worked. My first real encounter with IT was when I was about 15, I had gotten my first xbox and the game “Call of Duty” with it. This game was multiplayer as well as solo. I am normally a very social person so team games and games with friends are my favourite where collaboration and constant communication is required to achieve common goals.

Naturally as I grew older and my interests kept changing, I had dabbled in Html coding in high school which was very intriguing to me. However my IT journey stopped there for a while. I then started playing various team sports such as cricket, basketball and soccer. All these sports gave me experience on how to be a functional and productive member of a team. Growing up I saw the evolution of technology and gaming take place in front of me, things like games graphics were becoming more aesthetic, devices like phones having facial recognition, apps being developed for food tracking. I knew right away it was something I wanted to be a part of. I always enjoyed working in teams and knew in the future I would thourouly enjoy doing something that requires various team work/management skills.

IT has such a huge range of fields and is such an ever growing industry, I believe jobs in IT will only grow as more things start to move online like we have seen over time. This made IT appeal to me because it is a safe career path and will never be irrelevant. IT is so broad which is perfect for me to find what working environment/field I will enjoy and thrive in the most. 
 
 
 
 
In order to start my IT journey I had to get some sort of foundation in IT as well as knowledge and experience, this is when I decided to pick RMIT as my college to pursue my studies and complete my bachelor degree in. RMIT Online offered the perfect schedule and flexibility  I wanted to start my IT journey which made it super appealing to me personally. 
In my studies I expect to learn about all major concepts of IT and computing as well as deep knowledge in a certain field I like. I expect to explore and learn various coding languages such as python, Java, Html and C++. IT is a very wide field and has many components to it, though I have no real previous background in IT I’m excited to see which area of IT my study journey takes me to. During my time studying at RMIT I will be learning various useful skills such as time management, professional writing, creative thinking and problem solving, Experience in contributing to group projects and working in teams. All of these skills are required in order for me to pursue my ideal Job of becoming a IT project manager. Through this course I will gain expertise in IT and computing, I plan to use my knowledge and gained computing expertise to improve project and process flows, investigate technical issues and make a real difference in my workplace as a team leader. 
Ideal Job (Find AD for ideal job, maybe 6-8 year experience required. Something to work towards) 
Include Following: (PROJECT MANAGER) 
Description of position (in own words), what makes it appealing? 
Description of skill (in own words), qualifications and experience required for position. 
Description (in own words) of skills, qualifications and experience you currently have. 
Plan of how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required, building on those you have now. This needs to be greatly detailed,(and will probably change overtime but be specific) 
 
(My ideal job or more I should say goal job would be to become a IT project manager. An IT project managers role is to….) This job is particularly appealing to me because of my social nature and love for working and leading teams to achieve a common goal. I have been involved in team sports and games for all my life growing up and always enjoyed it. Becoming a IT project manager really allows me to showcase my leadership and managements skills. This position will have me working in a team setting where I can thrive and most.

Though I have no current skills In the IT field brides little coding I did in high school I have a very large skill base attained from my years of team sports and online team gaming. Some of these skills include team coordination, team communication, outlining objectives and setting plans with team members to efficiently execute them. Online games require strong verbal communication in order to coordinate and execute a common objective successfully and efficiently for example. I have been playing these games since the age of 13 and have since been building my verbal coordination skills without even knowing it, This is an essential skill for a project manager. In high school like most kids I played various Sports mostly team sports. Team sports require a high level of team coordination and communication often in high stress and real time situations, adaptability and problem solving is a key skill needed to be a functional member in a Team sport. Often conflicts arise as well in sports and dealing with them is a common practice, dealing with these situations over years has helped develop my skills in solving conflicts between individuals in teams. This is also an essential skill a project manager must have in order to avoid any disruptions to work flow. High school offers many opportunities for group work and collaboration with peers on various projects, Experience in working with groups and in teams I have acquired over years will help me in my journey to becoming a IT project manager and completing further team projects in the future. 
All goals require a plan in order to be executed, in order to achieve my ideal Job I will be completing my Bachelor in IT through RMIT University and after will be doing (whatever you need to do for project manager). Studying with fellow students and collaborating with them throughout my learning will further my team work skills and experience more specifically in IT projects rather than sports.  
After completing my bachelors I intend to get a graduate position in (some IT job that may further help to gain experience for project manager job) whilst studying as well to become a IT project manager. I naturally have great team work and leadership skills so building on these will not be a problem for myself throughout my IT career. I intend to then use my gained knowledge and experience through my studies and young professional career to improve work and project flow, identify and resolve issues promptly, manage time and risk efficiently and be a team leader that helps grow his team work efficiency.

Overview(100 words) - should be s summary of what the project will be. 
 
 
Security is an ever growing problem as criminals are becoming more resourceful in their methods where traditional systems with passcodes or passwords just don’t cut it anymore . Typical problems arise in the household security where people tend to lose the keys, security cards or forget the passwords to gain entry. On loosing the keys the owner or users are forced to change all the locks which is not only costing money but also open a window for the someone to gain entry. It is time consuming and impacts other family members as well. Other new systems which require passcodes to gain entry have similar issues of people forgetting passwords thus restricting their access to home. Resetting passwords can be a time consuming activity and costly exercise if the system is complex.  
 
 
Facial detection software will allow users to have a stronger and more strict layer of security to gain access to their homes. This will eliminate needs for physical objects such as keycards, keys or other devices to have access to home.  
 
 
This project focuses on building a face detection software which will provide users with keyless and remote entry to their house and related services using OpenCV library. This program will be constructed in such a way that it will detect and give access to the users through livestream videos from webcam, mobile phones, computer or any other portable devices having integrated cameras. Software will use information stored in the pre defined profiles as XML classifiers to detect faces in real time and also providing tracking. These user profile classifiers can also identify various other service objects through this detection method. Security is an ever growing problem as criminals become more resourceful in their methods normal passcodes or passwords just don’t cut it anymore. Facial detection software allows users to have a stronger and more strict layer of security. This Facial detection software can detected set users that are allowed access restricted files or rooms and has multiple implications. 
 
 
Motivation(100 words) - why useful or interesting, stats or evidence such as “There is 1.5 billion cat owners in Aus, and so huge market for an automated feeder. Using raspberry Pi technology is a cheap and easily assembled solution.” 
 
 
The facial detection and recognition is a growing industry which has  many uses specifically in different applications. It has been taking over the traditional passcode/passwords that have been used to gain access to homes and private data. It is so relevant that by 2024, the global facial recognition market could generate $7 billion in revenue. Facial detection softwares have been evolving and only getting better, The layer of security and accuracy provided is unmatched. By 2025 72% of hotel operators are expected to deploy facial recognition to identify and interact with guests. This technology will only become more relevant as more data is being stored online and its adoption by various industries. Some of the other key statistics have been documented by various articles below. 
 
 
  By 2023, 97% of airports will roll out facial recognition technology. (Reservations.com) 
Between 2014 and 2018, facial recognition software became 20 times better at searching databases to find a matching photograph. (NIST) 
According to Apple, the probability that a random person could look at someone else’s iPhone X and unlock it using Face ID is approximately 1 in 1,000,000. (Apple) 
49% of people agree that facial recognition should be used in stores if it catches shoplifters. (Statista) 
 
 
Description(500 words) - detailed description of the features of the products or service 
The use of facial recognition and smart security for residential protection is perhaps one of the more exciting innovations. It’s a user friendly system using proven technology operating within the privacy of people’s homes to protect their family and belongings. 
A face detection home security system will be equipped with facial recognition to arm or disarm the main access  automatically when members of the home are gone or present. If the system picks up an individual recognized as a household member, it knows there is no need to raise the alarm also. If the armed system identifies an individual on the premises who is not a member of the household or an authorized visitor, it can immediately flag the intruder to both household members and first responders as per the reporting mechanism.  
Facial recognition is by far the most powerful and relevant AI biometric technology. It can be incredibly vast in its ability to carry out a number of tasks beyond just face detection or face recognition. The more robust and feature-forward a facial recognition platform is, like FaceMe®, the more benefits and less biases it brings. 
The key features of a facial recognition engine are: 
Face detection 
Face detection is the first step the technology takes to detect a face. In this step, the technology works by scanning the whole image to see if any area contains full or even partial human faces. Fast and precise face detection is a critical first step to ensure the performance of the entire facial recognition process. FaceMe® can detect more than one face at once, count how many faces are present and perform detection on each of them individually. 
This software will have A lot of facial matching algorithms, using tens or hundreds of             feature detection points on a face in order to establish identity.  A better algorithm can             result in a much higher degree of accuracy. 
 
Face feature extraction 
Feature extraction is the step following detection. The engine extracts an n-dimensional vector set (called template) from the face image. Achieving very high precision requires a high "n" value, let's say 1024. The template that is extracted from an individual's face is used for matching or searching next. 
Face recognition 
The newly extracted template is then matched to those pre-enrolled in a database. A 1:N search is done by matching an individual's template to the entire database, to find the best match and confirm the person's identity. FaceMe® only stores encrypted template data. No actual face images are stored through our platform, fully protecting privacy. 
 
Smart locks  
Smart locks are growing in popularity to provide access to homes, restricted buildings, rooms, devices and cabinets. They work by granting access using a wireless protocol and cryptographic key for authorization. 
Facial recognition can be embedded into smart locks to provide credential access to restricted areas in the houshold for authorized people only. They are used in both commercial and residential settings. Only once an individual’s identity has been recognized and authenticated through facial recognition, will the smart lock grant access. 
Preventing unidentified or block listed individuals from entering premises 
Facial recognition operates by matching live images against a database of pre-enrolled identities, enabling much better monitoring of protected premises and alerting key personnel if an unidentified or banned individual enters. 
For example, consider schools where children’s safety is a top priority. School safety has become a key issue for parents and teachers. Smart security systems using facial recognition technology can help authorities better monitor people coming and going throughout entire day. The moment a known criminal or an unidentified adult approaches or enters the school, the system can alert the proper authorities for immediate action. 
Similar security features apply to retailers. A retail store might have a history with a customer that repeatedly threatens or coerces the staff, or has been caught shoplifting. A smart security system using facial recognition can be configured to alert in-store security and notify authorities should this frequent shoplifter or disgruntled individual enter the store. 
 
This facial recognition system will assemble a database of user's key attributes that can be matched against. This ensures that no 
Historical data and report of user access 
The right set of analytics can help prevent risk of future crimes. First, it’s crucial for enterprises to be able to view aggregate data across multiple store locations. Face recognition analytics should help companies easily identify which times of day and which locations are experiencing the highest number of matches, so that each location can be accurately staffed up. Enterprise face detection systems should also offer historical data about when criminals or banned customers have visited locations in the past. Finally, the system should offer the ability to segment face recognition data into groups, zones, locations and other tags in order to better identify retail crime patterns. 
 
BUILT-IN PRIVACY PROTECTION 
An enterprise face recognition company shouldn’t just think about its customers, but also its customers’ customers. That’s why it’s important to invest in a face detection system that is built to protect privacy. Some privacy-related features to look for include: 
Data encryption– Image data is encrypted both at rest and during transmission. 
Data breach precautions– Biometric templates stored within the facial recognition system should never be converted back into a face image in the case of a data breach. 
Data purging– Surveillance data should be automatically purged at regular intervals in accordance with industry best practices 
Anti-profiling– Facial recognition systems should be built to prevent profiling by race, age, gender or national origin. 
 
 
Tools and technologies(100 words) - describe the software, hardware and/or equipment needed. Include any relevant open source tools as appropriate.  
Facial detection home security system will be deployed using various off the shelf and cloud-based solutions, such as those from Microsoft and Amazon, or by integrating SDKs or software onto edge-devices. While each approach offers distinct benefits, edge-based facial recognition is generally deemed superior, offering better speed, security, affordability, flexibility and versatility. 
Facial Recognition Software  
Facial detection home security system is essentially delivered as a software technology. FaceMe® is a software development kit (SDK). It can be customized and integrated into multiple devices on a network, with key use cases for edge-based IoT and AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things.) As an SDK, FaceMe® can be integrated into virtually any device and operating system. Please refer to Facial Recognition at the Edge – The Ultimate Guide 2021 for details on choosing facial recognition software. 
 
CyberLink's FaceMe® SDK (Software Development Kit) perfectly exemplifies a good edge-based facial recognition solution. This highly competitive and flexible product is easy to integrate across a wide range of edge devices. FaceMe® leads the way by offering one of the market's most comprehensive chipsets and OS support. Its highly accurate AI engine is ranked one of the best in the NIST Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT). Through constant innovation, the technology meets the highest accuracy and security standards, for deployments across industries and use cases. FaceMe® can be deployed across a wide range of scenarios, including security, access control, public safety, smart banking, smart retail, smart city and home protection 
Hardware for Facial Recognition 
On hardware considerations, there is no one-size fits all approach to facial recognition. Solutions should always be customized to the end-user and their industry, as well as the specific use case’s needs and scope. 
There are endless hardware options capable of running facial recognition. Some of the most common include PCs, workstations and smart IoT or AIoT devices. For each type of device, there are several options for chipset or camera type which can be used. This is on top of a number of other considerations, each having an impact on performance and the total cost of ownership. For details, please read Facial Recognition at the Edge – The Ultimate Guide 2021.
